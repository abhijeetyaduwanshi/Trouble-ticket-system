Trouble ticket for any help desk (sometimes called a trouble report) is a mechanism used in an organization to create, track, report, and resolute technical and operational issues.
Trouble ticketing systems originated in manufacturing as a paper-based reporting system; now most are Web-based and associated with customer relationship management (CRM) environments, such as call centers or e-business Web sites, or with high-level technology environments such as network operations centers (NOCs).
So basically for the IT help desk you're looking at creating a trouble ticket system/tracker that helps the department track items that represent trouble to some user. Ex. I am an accountant for the company and I call the help desk to state I am having trouble with my PC. So the Help Desk creates a trouble ticket noting the problem. And until the problem gets fixed, the ticket really remains active.
CRUD database techniques.

Working....
The GUI of the application is pretty simple and self-explanatory.
The application has four features to CREATE or START or SAVE the ticket, VIEW the ticket, UPDATE the ticket and finally it has the option of DELETING or CLOSING the ticket. Along with this there is another option for LOADING the full table to default.

There are five input fields in the application to enter the ticket information namely ID, NAME, EMAIL address, ISSUE and STATUS of the ticket. Each field is defined with a proper label.

There is an additional option in the application to search a perticular ticket. The user can select the index with the help of the drop down menu at the very beginning of the application and then enter the corresponding value in the field to search for a ticket.

Functionality….
The ticket can be CREATED or STARTED or SAVED with first entering the valid information in the fields in the very bottom of the application and then clicking the SAVE TICKET option. All the fields are required with the valid data or else there will be an error message by the application.

To view the ticket in detail we have to select any of the ticket in the table first and then click the VIEW TICKET option. Before selecting the ticket from the table and clicking VIEW TICKET option will give an error message.

If there is any change in the ticket, it can be updated by selecting the ticket in the table and then clicking the UPDTE TICKET option. All the related data to the ticket will be filled in the fields in the bottom of the application and then the changes can be done. All the fields are required with valid data. Before selecting the ticket from the table and clicking UPDATE TICKET option will give an error message.

The ticket can be DELETED or CLOSED by selecting the ticket in the table and then clicking the DELETE TICKET option and then the application will ask the user to confirm the deletion. If the user selects YES then the ticket will be deleted and will no longer be a part of the application. This action will be non-reversible. If the user selects NO then he will come back to the application with having that ticket still as a part of the application. Before selecting the ticket from the table and clicking DELETE TICKET option will give an error message.

There is a SEARCH option in the very top of the application. The user have to select the index of the search with which he wants to search the ticket. The index can be selected with the dropdown menu and then entering the text to search.
E.g. select name in the drop down menu and then entering the name in the field. All the tickets with that name will show and others will hide.

To again load the table to default the user have to select the LOAD TABLE option where the table will be refreshed and all the tickets will show.
